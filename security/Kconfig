	  support as they are the only way to mark executables for soft mode use.

	  Soft mode can be activated by using the "pax_softmode=1" kernel command
	  line option on boot.  Furthermore you can control various PaX features
	  at runtime via the entries in /proc/sys/kernel/pax.

	  numerous drawbacks (no support for soft-mode, toolchain does not
	  know about the non-standard use of the ELF header) therefore it
	  has been deprecated in favour of PT_PAX_FLAGS and XATTR_PAX_FLAGS
	  support.

	  Note that if you enable PT_PAX_FLAGS or XATTR_PAX_FLAGS marking

	  not tolerate chpax/paxctl changes.  The main drawback is that
	  extended attributes are not supported by some filesystems (e.g.,
	  isofs, udf, vfat) so copying files through such filesystems will
	  lose the extended attributes and these PaX markings.

	  Note that if you enable the legacy EI_PAX marking support as well,

	  By design some architectures do not allow for protecting memory
	  pages against execution or even if they do, Linux does not make
	  use of this feature.  In practice this means that if a page is
	  readable (such as the stack or heap) it is also executable.

	  There is a well known exploit technique that makes use of this
	  fact and a common programming mistake where an attacker can
	  introduce code of his choice somewhere in the attacked program's
	  memory (typically the stack or the heap) and then execute it.

	  If the attacked program was running with different (typically
	  higher) privileges than that of the attacker, then he can elevate
	  his own privilege level (e.g. get a root shell, write to files for
	  which he does not have write access to, etc).

	  Enabling this option will let you choose from various features
	  that prevent the injection and execution of 'foreign' code in
	  a program.

	  This will also break programs that rely on the old behaviour and

	  There are some programs and libraries that for one reason or

	  signal handler return code generated by the kernel itself and
	  the GCC trampolines.

	  If you enabled CONFIG_PAX_PAGEEXEC or CONFIG_PAX_SEGMEXEC then
	  such programs will no longer work under your kernel.

	  As a remedy you can say Y here and use the 'chpax' or 'paxctl'
	  utilities to enable trampoline emulation for the affected programs
	  yet still have the protection provided by the non-executable pages.

	  On parisc you MUST enable this option and EMUSIGRT as well, otherwise
	  your system will not even boot.

	  Alternatively you can say N here and use the 'chpax' or 'paxctl'
	  utilities to disable CONFIG_PAX_PAGEEXEC and CONFIG_PAX_SEGMEXEC
	  for the affected files.

	  NOTE: enabling this feature *may* open up a loophole in the
	  protection provided by non-executable pages that an attacker
	  could abuse.  Therefore the best solution is to not have any
	  files on your system that would require this option.  This can
	  be achieved by not using libc5 (which relies on the kernel
	  signal handler return code) and not using or rewriting programs
	  that make use of the nested function implementation of GCC.

	  NOTE: this feature cannot be disabled on a per executable basis

	  an already existing ELF library that does not have position
	  independent code in it and use mprotect() on it to make it
	  writable and copy his code there.  While protecting against
	  the former approach is beyond PaX, the latter can be prevented
	  by having only PIC ELF libraries on one's system (which do not

	  can specify the minimum amount in MB that will be reserved.
	  Due to the same implementation details this size will always
	  be rounded up to the next 2/4 MB boundary (depends on PAE) so
	  the actually available memory for runtime allocated code will
	  usually be more than this minimum.

	  The default 4 MB should be enough for most users but if you have
	  an excessive number of modules (e.g., most distribution configs
	  compile many drivers as modules) or use huge modules such as
	  nvidia's kernel driver, you will need to adjust this amount.
	  A good rule of thumb is to look at your currently loaded kernel
	  modules and add up their sizes.

config PAX_ASLR
	bool "Address Space Layout Randomization"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	help
	  Many if not most exploit techniques rely on the knowledge of
	  certain addresses in the attacked program.  The following options
	  will allow the kernel to apply a certain amount of randomization
	  to specific parts of the program thereby forcing an attacker to
	  guess them in most cases.  Any failed guess will most likely crash
	  the attacked program which allows the kernel to detect such attempts
	  and react on them.  PaX itself provides no reaction mechanisms,
	  instead it is strongly encouraged that you make use of grsecurity's
	  (http://www.grsecurity.net/) built-in crash detection features or
	  develop one yourself.

	  By saying Y here you can choose to randomize the following areas:
	   - top of the task's kernel stack
	   - top of the task's userland stack
	   - base address for mmap() requests that do not specify one
	     (this includes all libraries)
	   - base address of the main executable

	  It is strongly recommended to say Y here as address space layout
	  randomization has negligible impact on performance yet it provides
	  a very effective protection.

	  NOTE: you can use the 'chpax' or 'paxctl' utilities to control
	  this feature on a per file basis.

	help
	  By saying Y here the kernel will randomize every task's kernel
	  stack on every system call.  This will not only force an attacker
	  to guess it but also prevent him from making use of possible
	  leaked information about it.

	  Since the kernel stack is a rather scarce resource, randomization
	  may cause unexpected stack overflows, therefore you should very
	  carefully test your system.  Note that once enabled in the kernel
	  configuration, this feature cannot be disabled on a per file basis.

config PAX_RANDMMAP
	bool "Randomize user stack and mmap() bases"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	depends on PAX_ASLR
	select PAX_RANDUSTACK
	help
	  By saying Y here the kernel will randomize every task's userland
	  stack and use a randomized base address for mmap() requests that
	  do not specify one themselves.

	  The stack randomization is done in two steps where the second
	  one may apply a big amount of shift to the top of the stack and
	  cause problems for programs that want to use lots of memory (more
	  than 2.5 GB if SEGMEXEC is not active, or 1.25 GB when it is).

	  As a result of mmap randomization all dynamically loaded libraries
	  will appear at random addresses and therefore be harder to exploit
	  by a technique where an attacker attempts to execute library code
	  for his purposes (e.g. spawn a shell from an exploited program that
	  is running at an elevated privilege level).

	  Furthermore, if a program is relinked as a dynamic ELF file, its
	  base address will be randomized as well, completing the full
	  randomization of the address space layout.  Attacking such programs
	  becomes a guess game.  You can find an example of doing this at
	  http://pax.grsecurity.net/et_dyn.tar.gz and practical samples at
	  http://www.grsecurity.net/grsec-gcc-specs.tar.gz .

	  NOTE: you can use the 'chpax' or 'paxctl' utilities to control this
	  feature on a per file basis.

config PAX_MEMORY_SANITIZE
	bool "Sanitize all freed memory"
	default y if (GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO && GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_PRIORITY_SECURITY)
	help
	  By saying Y here the kernel will erase memory pages and slab objects
	  as soon as they are freed.  This in turn reduces the lifetime of data
	  stored in them, making it less likely that sensitive information such
	  as passwords, cryptographic secrets, etc stay in memory for too long.

	  This is especially useful for programs whose runtime is short, long
	  lived processes and the kernel itself benefit from this as long as
	  they ensure timely freeing of memory that may hold sensitive
	  information.

	  A nice side effect of the sanitization of slab objects is the
	  reduction of possible info leaks caused by padding bytes within the
	  leaky structures.  Use-after-free bugs for structures containing
	  pointers can also be detected as dereferencing the sanitized pointer
	  will generate an access violation.

	  The tradeoff is performance impact, on a single CPU system kernel
	  compilation sees a 3% slowdown, other systems and workloads may vary
	  and you are advised to test this feature on your expected workload
	  before deploying it.

	  The slab sanitization feature excludes a few slab caches per default
	  for performance reasons.  To extend the feature to cover those as
	  well, pass "pax_sanitize_slab=full" as kernel command line parameter.

	  To reduce the performance penalty by sanitizing pages only, albeit
	  limiting the effectiveness of this feature at the same time, slab
	  sanitization can be disabled with the kernel command line parameter
	  "pax_sanitize_slab=off".

	  Note that this feature does not protect data stored in live pages,
	  e.g., process memory swapped to disk may stay there for a long time.

config PAX_MEMORY_STACKLEAK
	bool "Sanitize kernel stack"
	default y if (GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO && GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_PRIORITY_SECURITY)
	depends on X86 && GCC_PLUGINS
	help
	  By saying Y here the kernel will erase the kernel stack before it
	  returns from a system call.  This in turn reduces the information
	  that a kernel stack leak bug can reveal.

	  Note that such a bug can still leak information that was put on
	  the stack by the current system call (the one eventually triggering
	  the bug) but traces of earlier system calls on the kernel stack
	  cannot leak anymore.

	  The tradeoff is performance impact: on a single CPU system kernel
	  compilation sees a 1% slowdown, other systems and workloads may vary
	  and you are advised to test this feature on your expected workload
	  before deploying it.

	  Note that the full feature requires a gcc with plugin support,
	  i.e., gcc 4.5 or newer.  You may need to install the supporting
	  headers explicitly in addition to the normal gcc package.  Using
	  older gcc versions means that functions with large enough stack
	  frames may leave uninitialized memory behind that may be exposed
	  to a later syscall leaking the stack.

config PAX_MEMORY_STRUCTLEAK
	bool "Forcibly initialize local variables copied to userland"
	default y if (GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO && GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_PRIORITY_SECURITY)
	depends on GCC_PLUGINS
	help
	  By saying Y here the kernel will zero initialize some local
	  variables that are going to be copied to userland.  This in
	  turn prevents unintended information leakage from the kernel
	  stack should later code forget to explicitly set all parts of
	  the copied variable.

	  The tradeoff is less performance impact than PAX_MEMORY_STACKLEAK
	  at a much smaller coverage.

	  Note that the implementation requires a gcc with plugin support,
	  i.e., gcc 4.5 or newer.  You may need to install the supporting
	  headers explicitly in addition to the normal gcc package.

config PAX_MEMORY_UDEREF

	select PAX_PER_CPU_PGD if X86_64
	help
	  By saying Y here the kernel will be prevented from dereferencing
	  userland pointers in contexts where the kernel expects only kernel
	  pointers.  This is both a useful runtime debugging feature and a
	  security measure that prevents exploiting a class of kernel bugs.

	  The tradeoff is that some virtualization solutions may experience
	  a huge slowdown and therefore you should not enable this feature
	  for kernels meant to run in such environments.  Whether a given VM
	  solution is affected or not is best determined by simply trying it
	  out, the performance impact will be obvious right on boot as this
	  mechanism engages from very early on.  A good rule of thumb is that
	  VMs running on CPUs without hardware virtualization support (i.e.,
	  the majority of IA-32 CPUs) will likely experience the slowdown.

	  On X86_64 the kernel will make use of PCID support when available
	  (Intel's Westmere, Sandy Bridge, etc) for better security (default)
	  or performance impact.  Pass pax_weakuderef on the kernel command
	  line to choose the latter.

config PAX_REFCOUNT

	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	depends on GRKERNSEC && ((ARM && (CPU_V6 || CPU_V6K || CPU_V7)) || MIPS || PPC || SPARC64 || X86)
	help
	  By saying Y here the kernel will detect and prevent overflowing
	  various (but not all) kinds of object reference counters.  Such
	  overflows can normally occur due to bugs only and are often, if
	  not always, exploitable.

	  The tradeoff is that data structures protected by an overflowed
	  refcount will never be freed and therefore will leak memory.  Note
	  that this leak also happens even without this protection but in
	  that case the overflow can eventually trigger the freeing of the
	  data structure while it is still being used elsewhere, resulting
	  in the exploitable situation that this feature prevents.

	  Since this has a negligible performance impact, you should enable
	  this feature.

config PAX_USERCOPY
	bool "Harden memory copies between kernel and userland"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	depends on GRKERNSEC && HAVE_ARCH_HARDENED_USERCOPY
	select HARDENED_USERCOPY
	help
	  By saying Y here the kernel will enforce the size of heap objects
	  when they are copied in either direction between the kernel and
	  userland, even if only a part of the heap object is copied.

	  Specifically, this checking prevents information leaking from the
	  kernel heap during kernel to userland copies (if the kernel heap
	  object is otherwise fully initialized) and prevents kernel heap
	  overflows during userland to kernel copies.

	  Note that the current implementation provides the strictest bounds
	  checks for the SLUB allocator.

	  Enabling this option also enables per-slab cache protection against
	  data in a given cache being copied into/out of via userland
	  accessors.  Though the whitelist of regions will be reduced over
	  time, it notably protects important data structures like task structs.

	  If frame pointers are enabled on x86, this option will also restrict
	  copies into and out of the kernel stack to local variables within a
	  single frame.

	  Since this has a negligible performance impact, you should enable
	  this feature.

config PAX_CONSTIFY_PLUGIN
	bool "Automatically constify eligible structures"
	default y
	depends on !UML && PAX_KERNEXEC && GCC_PLUGINS

	  By saying Y here the compiler will automatically constify a class

	  Note that the implementation requires a gcc with plugin support,
	  i.e., gcc 4.5 or newer.  You may need to install the supporting
	  headers explicitly in addition to the normal gcc package.

	  Note that if some code really has to modify constified variables
	  then the source code will have to be patched to allow it.  Examples
	  can be found in PaX itself (the no_const attribute) and for some
	  out-of-tree modules at http://www.grsecurity.net/~paxguy1/ .

config PAX_SIZE_OVERFLOW_EXTRA
	bool "Increase coverage of size overflow checking"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO

config PAX_INITIFY

config PAX_LATENT_ENTROPY
	bool "Generate some entropy during boot and runtime"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	depends on GCC_PLUGINS
	select GCC_PLUGIN_LATENT_ENTROPY
	help
	  By saying Y here the kernel will instrument some kernel code to
	  extract some entropy from both original and artificially created
	  program state.  This will help especially embedded systems where
	  there is little 'natural' source of entropy normally.  The cost
	  is some slowdown of the boot process (about 0.5%) and fork and
	  irq processing.

	  When pax_extra_latent_entropy is passed on the kernel command line,
	  entropy will be extracted from up to the first 4GB of RAM while the
	  runtime memory allocator is being initialized.  This costs even more
	  slowdown of the boot process.

	  Note that the implementation requires a gcc with plugin support,
	  i.e., gcc 4.5 or newer.  You may need to install the supporting
	  headers explicitly in addition to the normal gcc package.

	  Note that entropy extracted this way is not cryptographically
	  secure!

config PAX_RAP
	bool "Prevent code reuse attacks"
	depends on X86_64 && GCC_PLUGINS
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	help
	  By saying Y here the kernel will check indirect control transfers
	  in order to detect and prevent attacks that try to hijack control
	  flow by overwriting code pointers.

	  If you have an amd64 processor that does not support SMEP then you
	  must also enable a KERNEXEC code pointer instrumentation method
	  (see PAX_KERNEXEC_PLUGIN).

	  Note that binary modules cannot be instrumented by this approach.

	  Note that the implementation requires a gcc with plugin support,
