config GRKERNSEC_KMEM
	bool "Deny reading/writing to /dev/kmem, /dev/mem, and /dev/port"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	select STRICT_DEVMEM if (X86 || ARM || TILE || S390)
	help
	  If you say Y here, /dev/kmem and /dev/mem won't be allowed to
	  be written to or read from to modify or leak the contents of the running
	  kernel.  /dev/port will also not be allowed to be opened, writing to
	  /dev/cpu/*/msr will be prevented, and support for kexec will be removed.
	  If you have module support disabled, enabling this will close up several
	  ways that are currently used to insert malicious code into the running
	  kernel.

	  Even with this feature enabled, we still highly recommend that
	  you use the RBAC system, as it is still possible for an attacker to
	  modify the running kernel through other more obscure methods.

	  Enabling this feature will prevent the "cpupower" and "powertop" tools
	  from working and excludes debugfs from being compiled into the kernel.

	  It is highly recommended that you say Y here if you meet all the
	  conditions above.

config GRKERNSEC_VM86
	bool "Restrict VM86 mode"
	default y if (GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO && GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_SERVER)
	depends on X86_32

	help
	  If you say Y here, only processes with CAP_SYS_RAWIO will be able to
	  make use of a special execution mode on 32bit x86 processors called
	  Virtual 8086 (VM86) mode.  XFree86 may need vm86 mode for certain
	  video cards and will still work with this option enabled.  The purpose
	  of the option is to prevent exploitation of emulation errors in
	  virtualization of vm86 mode like the one discovered in VMWare in 2009.
	  Nearly all users should be able to enable this option.

config GRKERNSEC_IO
	bool "Disable privileged I/O"
	default y if (GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO && GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_SERVER)
	depends on X86
	select RTC_CLASS
	select RTC_INTF_DEV
	select RTC_DRV_CMOS

	help
	  If you say Y here, all ioperm and iopl calls will return an error.
	  Ioperm and iopl can be used to modify the running kernel.
	  Unfortunately, some programs need this access to operate properly,
	  the most notable of which are XFree86 and hwclock.  hwclock can be
	  remedied by having RTC support in the kernel, so real-time 
	  clock support is enabled if this option is enabled, to ensure 
	  that hwclock operates correctly.  If hwclock still does not work,
	  either update udev or symlink /dev/rtc to /dev/rtc0.

	  If you're using XFree86 or a version of Xorg from 2012 or earlier,
	  you may not be able to boot into a graphical environment with this
	  option enabled.  In this case, you should use the RBAC system instead.

config GRKERNSEC_BPF_HARDEN
	bool "Harden BPF interpreter"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	help
	  Unlike previous versions of grsecurity that hardened both the BPF
	  interpreted code against corruption at rest as well as the JIT code
	  against JIT-spray attacks and attacker-controlled immediate values
	  for ROP, this feature will enforce disabling of the new eBPF JIT engine
	  and will ensure the interpreted code is read-only at rest.  This feature
	  may be removed at a later time when eBPF stabilizes to entirely revert
	  back to the more secure pre-3.16 BPF interpreter/JIT.

	  If you're using KERNEXEC, it's recommended that you enable this option
	  to supplement the hardening of the kernel.
  
config GRKERNSEC_PERF_HARDEN
	bool "Disable unprivileged PERF_EVENTS usage by default"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	depends on PERF_EVENTS
	help
	  If you say Y here, the range of acceptable values for the
	  /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid sysctl will be expanded to allow and
	  default to a new value: 3.  When the sysctl is set to this value, no
	  unprivileged use of the PERF_EVENTS syscall interface will be permitted.

	  Though PERF_EVENTS can be used legitimately for performance monitoring
	  and low-level application profiling, it is forced on regardless of
	  configuration, has been at fault for several vulnerabilities, and
	  creates new opportunities for side channels and other information leaks.

	  This feature puts PERF_EVENTS into a secure default state and permits
	  the administrator to change out of it temporarily if unprivileged
	  application profiling is needed.

config GRKERNSEC_RAND_THREADSTACK
	bool "Insert random gaps between thread stacks"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	depends on PAX_RANDMMAP && !PPC
	help
	  If you say Y here, a random-sized gap will be enforced between allocated
	  thread stacks.  Glibc's NPTL and other threading libraries that
	  pass MAP_STACK to the kernel for thread stack allocation are supported.
	  The implementation currently provides 8 bits of entropy for the gap.

	  Many distributions do not compile threaded remote services with the
	  -fstack-check argument to GCC, causing the variable-sized stack-based
	  allocator, alloca(), to not probe the stack on allocation.  This
	  permits an unbounded alloca() to skip over any guard page and potentially
	  modify another thread's stack reliably.  An enforced random gap
	  reduces the reliability of such an attack and increases the chance
	  that such a read/write to another thread's stack instead lands in
	  an unmapped area, causing a crash and triggering grsecurity's
	  anti-bruteforcing logic.

config GRKERNSEC_PROC_MEMMAP
	bool "Harden ASLR against information leaks and entropy reduction"
	default y if (GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO || PAX_NOEXEC || PAX_ASLR)
	depends on PAX_NOEXEC || PAX_ASLR
	help
	  If you say Y here, the /proc/<pid>/maps and /proc/<pid>/stat files will
	  give no information about the addresses of its mappings if
	  PaX features that rely on random addresses are enabled on the task.
	  In addition to sanitizing this information and disabling other
	  dangerous sources of information, this option causes reads of sensitive
	  /proc/<pid> entries where the file descriptor was opened in a different
	  task than the one performing the read.  Such attempts are logged.
	  This option also limits argv/env strings for suid/sgid binaries
	  to 512KB to prevent a complete exhaustion of the stack entropy provided
	  by ASLR.  Finally, it places an 8MB stack resource limit on suid/sgid
	  binaries to prevent alternative mmap layouts from being abused.

	  If you use PaX it is essential that you say Y here as it closes up
	  several holes that make full ASLR useless locally.


config GRKERNSEC_KSTACKOVERFLOW
	bool "Prevent kernel stack overflows"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	depends on X86_64
	help
	  If you say Y here, the kernel's process stacks will be allocated
	  with vmalloc instead of the kernel's default allocator.  This
	  introduces guard pages that in combination with the alloca checking
	  of the STACKLEAK feature and removal of thread_info from the kernel
	  stack prevents all forms of kernel process stack overflow abuse.
          Note that this is different from kernel stack buffer overflows.

config GRKERNSEC_BRUTE
	bool "Deter exploit bruteforcing"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	help
	  If you say Y here, attempts to bruteforce exploits against forking
	  daemons such as apache or sshd, as well as against suid/sgid binaries
	  will be deterred.  When a child of a forking daemon is killed by PaX
	  or crashes due to an illegal instruction or other suspicious signal,
	  the parent process will be delayed 30 seconds upon every subsequent
	  fork until the administrator is able to assess the situation and
	  restart the daemon.
	  In the suid/sgid case, the attempt is logged, the user has all their
	  existing instances of the suid/sgid binary terminated and will
	  be unable to execute any suid/sgid binaries for 15 minutes.

	  It is recommended that you also enable signal logging in the auditing
	  section so that logs are generated when a process triggers a suspicious
	  signal.
	  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name
	  "deter_bruteforce" is created.

config GRKERNSEC_MODHARDEN
	bool "Harden module auto-loading"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	depends on MODULES
	help
	  If you say Y here, module auto-loading in response to use of some
	  feature implemented by an unloaded module will be restricted to
	  root users.  Enabling this option helps defend against attacks 
	  by unprivileged users who abuse the auto-loading behavior to 
	  cause a vulnerable module to load that is then exploited.

	  If this option prevents a legitimate use of auto-loading for a 
	  non-root user, the administrator can execute modprobe manually 
	  with the exact name of the module mentioned in the alert log.
	  Alternatively, the administrator can add the module to the list
	  of modules loaded at boot by modifying init scripts.

	  Modification of init scripts will most likely be needed on 
	  Ubuntu servers with encrypted home directory support enabled,
	  as the first non-root user logging in will cause the ecb(aes),
	  ecb(aes)-all, cbc(aes), and cbc(aes)-all  modules to be loaded.

config GRKERNSEC_HIDESYM
	bool "Hide kernel symbols"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	select PAX_USERCOPY
	help
	  If you say Y here, getting information on loaded modules, and
	  displaying all kernel symbols through a syscall will be restricted
	  to users with CAP_SYS_MODULE.  For software compatibility reasons,
	  /proc/kallsyms will be restricted to the root user.  The RBAC
	  system can hide that entry even from root.

	  This option also prevents leaking of kernel addresses through
	  several /proc entries.

	  Note that this option is only effective provided the following
	  conditions are met:
	  1) The kernel using grsecurity is not precompiled by some distribution
	  2) You have also enabled GRKERNSEC_DMESG
	  3) You are using the RBAC system and hiding other files such as your
	     kernel image and System.map.  Alternatively, enabling this option
	     causes the permissions on /boot, /lib/modules, and the kernel
	     source directory to change at compile time to prevent 
	     reading by non-root users.
	  If the above conditions are met, this option will aid in providing a
	  useful protection against local kernel exploitation of overflows
	  and arbitrary read/write vulnerabilities.

	  It is highly recommended that you enable GRKERNSEC_PERF_HARDEN
	  in addition to this feature.

config GRKERNSEC_RANDSTRUCT
	bool "Randomize layout of sensitive kernel structures"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	depends on GCC_PLUGINS
	select GRKERNSEC_HIDESYM
	select MODVERSIONS if MODULES
	help
	  If you say Y here, the layouts of a number of sensitive kernel
	  structures (task, fs, cred, etc) and all structures composed entirely
	  of function pointers (aka "ops" structs) will be randomized at compile-time.
	  This can introduce the requirement of an additional infoleak
	  vulnerability for exploits targeting these structure types.

	  Enabling this feature will introduce some performance impact, slightly
	  increase memory usage, and prevent the use of forensic tools like
	  Volatility against the system (unless the kernel source tree isn't
	  cleaned after kernel installation).

	  The seed used for compilation is located at tools/gcc/randomize_layout_seed.h.
	  It remains after a make clean to allow for external modules to be compiled
	  with the existing seed and will be removed by a make mrproper or
	  make distclean.

          Note that the implementation requires gcc 4.6.4. or newer.  You may need
	  to install the supporting headers explicitly in addition to the normal
	  gcc package.

config GRKERNSEC_RANDSTRUCT_PERFORMANCE
	bool "Use cacheline-aware structure randomization"
	depends on GRKERNSEC_RANDSTRUCT
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_PRIORITY_PERF
	help
	  If you say Y here, the RANDSTRUCT randomization will make a best effort
	  at restricting randomization to cacheline-sized groups of elements.  It
	  will further not randomize bitfields in structures.  This reduces the
	  performance hit of RANDSTRUCT at the cost of weakened randomization.

config GRKERNSEC_KERN_LOCKOUT
	bool "Active kernel exploit response"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	depends on X86 || ARM || PPC || SPARC
	help
	  If you say Y here, when a PaX alert is triggered due to suspicious
	  activity in the kernel (from KERNEXEC/UDEREF/USERCOPY)
	  or an OOPS occurs due to bad memory accesses, instead of just
	  terminating the offending process (and potentially allowing
	  a subsequent exploit from the same user), we will take one of two
	  actions:
	   If the user was root, we will panic the system
	   If the user was non-root, we will log the attempt, terminate
	   all processes owned by the user, then prevent them from creating
	   any new processes until the system is restarted
	  This deters repeated kernel exploitation/bruteforcing attempts
	  and is useful for later forensics.

config GRKERNSEC_OLD_ARM_USERLAND
	bool "Old ARM userland compatibility"
	depends on ARM && (CPU_V6 || CPU_V6K || CPU_V7)
	help
	  If you say Y here, stubs of executable code to perform such operations
	  as "compare-exchange" will be placed at fixed locations in the ARM vector
	  table.  This is unfortunately needed for old ARM userland meant to run
	  across a wide range of processors.  Without this option enabled,
	  the get_tls and data memory barrier stubs will be emulated by the kernel,
	  which is enough for Linaro userlands or other userlands designed for v6
	  and newer ARM CPUs.  It's recommended that you try without this option enabled
	  first, and only enable it if your userland does not boot (it will likely fail
	  at init time).

	  here if you have no intention of using the RBAC system, so as to prevent

config GRKERNSEC_SYMLINKOWN
	bool "Kernel-enforced SymlinksIfOwnerMatch"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO && GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_SERVER
	help
	  Apache's SymlinksIfOwnerMatch option has an inherent race condition
	  that prevents it from being used as a security feature.  As Apache
	  verifies the symlink by performing a stat() against the target of
	  the symlink before it is followed, an attacker can setup a symlink
	  to point to a same-owned file, then replace the symlink with one
	  that targets another user's file just after Apache "validates" the

	help
	  If you say Y here, sysfs (the pseudo-filesystem mounted at /sys) and
	  any filesystem normally mounted under it (e.g. debugfs) will be
	  mostly accessible only by root.  These filesystems generally provide access
	  to hardware and debug information that isn't appropriate for unprivileged
	  users of the system.  Sysfs and debugfs have also become a large source
	  of new vulnerabilities, ranging from infoleaks to local compromise.
	  There has been very little oversight with an eye toward security involved
	  in adding new exporters of information to these filesystems, so their
	  use is discouraged.
	  For reasons of compatibility, a few directories have been whitelisted
	  for access by non-root users:
	  /sys/fs/selinux
	  /sys/fs/fuse
	  /sys/devices/system/cpu

config GRKERNSEC_ROFS

	  will be protected in the following ways:
	  * No new writable mounts will be allowed
	  * Existing read-only mounts won't be able to be remounted read/write
	  * Write operations will be denied on all block devices
	  This option acts independently of grsec_lock: once it is set to 1,
	  it cannot be turned off.  Therefore, please be mindful of the resulting
	  behavior if this option is enabled in an init script on a read-only
	  filesystem.
	  Also be aware that as with other root-focused features, GRKERNSEC_KMEM
	  and GRKERNSEC_IO should be enabled and module loading disabled via

	  will be thwarted for unprivileged users.  If a process without
	  CAP_MKNOD stats such a device, the last access and last modify times
	  will match the device's create time.  No access or modify events
	  will be triggered through inotify/dnotify/fanotify for such devices.
	  This feature will prevent attacks that may at a minimum

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT

	  encounter no software incompatibilities with the following options, it
	  is recommended that you enable each one.

	  Note that the chroot restrictions are not intended to apply to "chroots"
	  to directories that are simple bind mounts of the global root filesystem.
	  For several other reasons, a user shouldn't expect any significant
	  security by performing such a chroot.

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_MOUNT

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_PIVOT

	help
	  If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to use
	  a function called pivot_root() that was introduced in Linux 2.3.41.  It
	  works similar to chroot in that it changes the root filesystem.  This
	  function could be misused in a chrooted process to attempt to break out
	  of the chroot, and therefore should not be allowed.  If the sysctl
	  option is enabled, a sysctl option with name "chroot_deny_pivot" is

	  If you say Y here, the current working directory of all newly-chrooted
	  applications will be set to the the root directory of the chroot.
	  The man page on chroot(2) states:
	  Note that this call does not change  the  current  working
	  directory,  so  that `.' can be outside the tree rooted at
	  `/'.  In particular, the  super-user  can  escape  from  a
	  `chroot jail' by doing `mkdir foo; chroot foo; cd ..'.

	  It is recommended that you say Y here, since it's not known to break
	  any software.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_CHMOD
	bool "Deny (f)chmod +s"

	depends on GRKERNSEC_CHROOT
	help
	  If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to chmod
	  or fchmod files to make them have suid or sgid bits.  This protects
	  against another published method of breaking a chroot.  If the sysctl
	  option is enabled, a sysctl option with name "chroot_deny_chmod" is
	  created.

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_FCHDIR
	bool "Deny fchdir and fhandle out of chroot"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO

	help
	  If you say Y here, a well-known method of breaking chroots by fchdir'ing
	  to a file descriptor of the chrooting process that points to a directory
	  outside the filesystem will be stopped.  This option also prevents use of
	  the recently-created syscall for opening files by a guessable "file handle"
	  inside a chroot, as well as accessing relative paths outside of a
	  directory passed in via file descriptor with openat and similar syscalls.
	  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name "chroot_deny_fchdir"

	depends on GRKERNSEC_CHROOT
	help
	  If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be allowed to
	  mknod.  The problem with using mknod inside a chroot is that it
	  would allow an attacker to create a device entry that is the same

	  If you say Y here, neither TCP resets nor ICMP
	  destination-unreachable packets will be sent in response to packets
	  sent to ports for which no associated listening process exists.
	  It will also prevent the sending of ICMP protocol unreachable packets
	  in response to packets with unknown protocols.
	  This feature supports both IPV4 and IPV6 and exempts the 
	  loopback interface from blackholing.  Enabling this feature 
	  makes a host more resilient to DoS attacks and reduces network
	  visibility against scanners.

	  The blackhole feature as-implemented is equivalent to the FreeBSD
	  blackhole feature, as it prevents RST responses to all packets, not
	  just SYNs.  Under most application behavior this causes no
	  problems, but applications (like haproxy) may not close certain
	  connections in a way that cleanly terminates them on the remote
	  end, leaving the remote host in LAST_ACK state.  Because of this
	  side-effect and to prevent intentional LAST_ACK DoSes, this
	  feature also adds automatic mitigation against such attacks.
	  The mitigation drastically reduces the amount of time a socket
	  can spend in LAST_ACK state.  If you're using haproxy and not
	  all servers it connects to have this option enabled, consider
	  disabling this feature on the haproxy host.

	  If the sysctl option is enabled, two sysctl options with names
	  "ip_blackhole" and "lastack_retries" will be created.
	  While "ip_blackhole" takes the standard zero/non-zero on/off
	  toggle, "lastack_retries" uses the same kinds of values as
	  "tcp_retries1" and "tcp_retries2".  The default value of 4
	  prevents a socket from lasting more than 45 seconds in LAST_ACK

	  for the connection is guessed correctly.

	  As the weakness could be used to prevent an antivirus or IPS from
	  fetching updates, or prevent an SSL gateway from fetching a CRL,
	  it should be eliminated by enabling this option.  Though Linux is

	int "Seconds in between log messages (minimum)"
	default 10
	help
	  This option allows you to enforce the number of seconds between
	  grsecurity log messages.  The default should be suitable for most
	  people, however, if you choose to change it, choose a value small enough
	  to allow informative logs to be produced, but large enough to
	  prevent flooding.

	  Setting both this value and GRKERNSEC_FLOODBURST to 0 will disable
	  any rate limiting on grsecurity log messages.

config GRKERNSEC_FLOODBURST
	int "Number of messages in a burst (maximum)"
	default 6
	help
	  This option allows you to choose the maximum number of messages allowed
	  within the flood time interval you chose in a separate option.  The
	  default should be suitable for most people, however if you find that
	  many of your logs are being interpreted as flooding, you may want to
	  raise this value.

	  Setting both this value and GRKERNSEC_FLOODTIME to 0 will disable
	  any rate limiting on grsecurity log messages.
